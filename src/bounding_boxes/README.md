Aufgaben:
* Step 1: Train Bounding Box
* Step 2: Train Bounding Box with 8 Coordinaten, for Wings as well
* Step 3: Train Segmentation


Notes:
For the bounding box, the default Dataset can not be used as the annotions for the Bounding Boxes are not included,
a modified copy of the dataset will be used. It is stored in the bounding_boxes folder, with following adaption:
bounding_box_train: 0 - 8000 = 8000 Datapoints
bounding_box_test: 8001 - 9900 = 1900 Datapoints
bouding_box_val: 9901 - 10000 = 99 Datapoints
